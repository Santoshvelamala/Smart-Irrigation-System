# Smart-Irrigation-System
This is a webapplication designed using Web2py.

Project idea is to control the motor(on/off/automatic) which is placed in a field using our webapplication.

This helps the farmer to get his farm details(moisture etc) by simply sitting at his home.

Communication between the webapplication and the motor is through SMS.

Web app sends On/Off commands to watermotor and GetMoisture commands to moisture sensor through sms.
